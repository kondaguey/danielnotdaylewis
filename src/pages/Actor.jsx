     <p className="actor__paragraph">Oh, the stories I have from being a professional actor for 10 years. While I am on hiatus, I still dabble in voice acting, and given the opportunity, I'd dive back in to stage and screen. Post-hiatus I traveled the world and began a dual-life in South Korea. Will update soon . . . I just wanted you to know this about me for the time being. Perhaps it makes me more creative and versatile in all of my other pursuits. Just an idea . . .  </p>
