          <p>I've taken great time and effort to work with this pre-processor in an advanced fashion. My styling workflow looks like a nice combo of the 7-1 Sass file architecture with BEM-naming conventions.</p>

        <h3>JS Stack</h3>
        <img src="./img/tech-logo-2.png" alt="img" />
        <p>After getting the basics of vanilla Javascript down, I was off to the races with the React frontend and node backend for powerful fullstack development written entirely in JavaScript. Now that I'm taking up power of SSG with Next.js for truly next-level app development.</p>

        <h3>NoSQL DB Stack</h3>
        <img src="./img/tech-logo-3.png" alt="img" />
        <p>Given that I've become quite fond of the MERN Stack, MondoDB enhanced with Mongoose.js is now my go-to database stack.</p>

        <h3>Blockchain / Web3 Stack</h3> 
        <img src="./img/tech-logo-4.png" alt="img" />
        <p>Ultimately, I'm going the direction of Web3 and the Blockchain. It's undoubtedly the next iteration of the web. Within the context of Web3 I'm walking on the cutting-edge of tomorrow. That's why in addition to Solidity, I'm learning <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4eSceDOS-Ms" target="_blank" >Motoko</a> from the <a href="https://dfinity.org/" target="_blank">DFINITY Foundation</a> to launch 100% on-chain DApps to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMuCZuPllEE" target="_blank">ICP</a>. Throw in Hardhat, and Moralis for safe measure, and I'll be building "Web3" versions of all my Web2 Apps in no time.</p>

    <h2>portfolio</h2>

    <p className="dev__projects__explainer">Aside from the projects listed below, this website itself is a living portfolio. It's a place for me to actively practice my craft of development and design in a safe place. As my skills and practice evolve, so will the website - becoming better and better with time. It's a direct reflection my my programming abilities in real-time, where I can also collect and share anything else I'm learning and evolving. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this could end up being a scaled enterprise app with functionality, with multiple businesses attached to it. The sky's the limit and I'm proud to make it my own.</p>
